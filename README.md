## Method

### Fase 1:

    - create an array with your name where each position corresponds to a letter
    - make a loop that traverses this array and displays each of the letters in the console

### Fase 2:

    - in the loop, if the letter is a vowel it prints on the console: "I found the VOWEL: _".
    - Otherwise, print: "I found the CONSONANT: __"
    - If you find a number, show by template: 'People names do not contain the number: __ "

### Fase 3:

     - store on a map both the letters in the list (or array) and the number of times they appear
